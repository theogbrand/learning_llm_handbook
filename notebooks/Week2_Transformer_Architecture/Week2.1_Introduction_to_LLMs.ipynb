    "## Loss Function: Quantifying Prediction Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The **loss function** is how we measure how well our model is performing. Specifically, it measures how \"surprised\" the model is when it sees the correct answer. The mathematical formulation we use is called **cross-entropy loss** or **log-likelihood loss**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower loss = better predictions = less surprise when seeing the correct answer\n",
    "- Higher loss = worse predictions = more surprise when seeing the correct answer\n",
    "- Loss is calculated as: Loss = -log(probability of correct word)\n",
    "- Training aims to minimize the total loss across all predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The logarithm has a **useful property**: it heavily penalizes very low probabilities. If the model assigns a probability of 0.01 to the correct word, the loss is much higher than if it assigns 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Training Dataset as Ground Truth\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the mathematical details, it's crucial to understand what the loss function is actually measuring and why it works. The loss function compares our model's predictions against what we call the **\"ground truth\"** - the training dataset that contains the correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Dataset as Golden Labels:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a language model, we provide it with a massive dataset of text (books, articles, websites, etc.). This dataset represents our best approximation of \"correct\" language use. Each sequence in this dataset serves as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ground Truth**: The actual words that should come next in real language\n",
    "- **Golden Labels**: The target answers our model should learn to predict\n",
    "- **Reference Distribution**: The pattern of language we want our model to internalize\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example sequence \"we love deep learning\", this represents a small piece of ground truth data. When we calculate loss, we're measuring how well our model's predictions align with this established pattern of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Random Weights to Meaningful Predictions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our initial model parameters from Section 1? Those weights were randomly initialized:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model_parameters = {\n",
    "    'layer1_weights': [0.1, -0.3, 0.5, 0.2, -0.1, 0.4, ...],\n",
    "    'layer2_weights': [0.2, 0.1, -0.4, 0.6, 0.3, -0.2, ...],\n",
    "    'output_weights': [0.3, -0.1, 0.4, -0.2, 0.5, 0.1, ...]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These random numbers produce the predictions we saw in previous sections. The model doesn't \"know\" anything about language initially - its probabilities for predicting \"we\" (0.149) or \"love\" (0.571) come purely from these random mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Training Objective: Fitting to the Dataset Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental goal of training is to **fit the model to the training dataset's distribution**. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Matching**: Adjust the weights so the model's predicted probabilities match the frequency patterns in the training data\n",
    "2. **Contextual Learning**: Teach the model that certain word combinations (like \"deep learning\") are more common than others\n",
    "3. **Pattern Internalization**: Embed the statistical regularities of human language into the neural network weights\n",
    "\n",
    "When we minimize the cross-entropy loss across millions of training examples, we're essentially forcing the model to internalize the probability distribution of the training dataset. The model learns that \"the\" is more common after \"<BOS>\" because it appears frequently in training data, not because it has any inherent understanding of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inductive Bias: The Hidden Consequence of Training Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This training process creates what we call an **inductive bias** - a set of assumptions and tendencies that the model develops based on its training data. This bias manifests in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Domain Bias**: If trained on academic papers, the model will favor formal language\n",
    "2. **Cultural Bias**: Training data reflects the cultural context of its sources\n",
    "3. **Temporal Bias**: Models reflect the time period when their training data was collected\n",
    "4. **Statistical Bias**: Common patterns in training data become \"preferred\" by the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model's tendency to predict \"the\" with high probability after \"<BOS>\" isn't based on understanding - it's an inductive bias learned from statistical patterns in training data where \"the\" frequently starts sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Circular Nature of Language Modeling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a profound circularity here: we use human-written text to train models to predict human-like text. The model doesn't learn \"language\" in an abstract sense - it learns to mimic the specific patterns present in its training distribution. This is why the choice of training data is so critical and why different models can have vastly different behaviors based on their training datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function, therefore, isn't just measuring prediction accuracy - it's measuring how well the model has absorbed and can reproduce the inductive biases present in its training data.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Problems with Basic Gradient Descent:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Same learning rate for all parameters**: Some parameters might need larger updates, others smaller\n",
    "2. **No momentum**: Can get stuck in local minima or oscillate\n",
    "3. **Sensitive to learning rate choice**: Too high or too low can prevent convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adam Optimizer Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adaptive learning rates**: Different learning rate for each parameter based on its gradient history\n",
    "2. **Momentum**: Uses moving averages of gradients to smooth out updates\n",
    "3. **Bias correction**: Adjusts for initialization bias in early iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adam Update Rules:**\n",
    "\n",

      "  1. Convert text to tokens: ['<BOS>', 'we', 'love', 'deep', 'learning']\n",
      "  2. For each position, compute logits using neural network layers:\n",

    "\n",
    "You may have noticed in our training simulation that some words learned faster than others:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"learning\"** reached high probability very quickly (0.994 → 1.000)\n",
    "- **\"we\"** took much longer to improve (0.149 → 0.956)\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern reflects real training dynamics in language models:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Later words in sequences often learn faster because:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More context available**: By the time we predict \"learning\", we have \"we love deep\" as context\n",
    "2. **Stronger constraints**: \"deep **_\" has fewer plausible completions than \"< BOS > _**\"\n",
    "3. **Clearer gradients**: Specific contexts lead to more focused gradient signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Earlier words are harder because:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Less context**: Starting tokens have minimal preceding information\n",
    "2. **Many valid options**: Sentences can begin with countless different words\n",
    "3. **Competing patterns**: Model must learn to distinguish when \"we\" vs \"the\" vs other starters are appropriate\n",
