    "# Week 6.2: Synthetic Evaluation Dataset Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resource Requirements:**\n",
    "- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4)\n",
    "- Anthropic API key (optional, for Claude)\n",
    "- Basic understanding of prompt engineering\n",
    "- Familiarity with structured outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the fundamentals of synthetic dataset generation for LLM evaluation\n",
    "- Learn how to create high-quality evaluation questions programmatically\n",
    "- Implement quality control mechanisms using LLM-as-judge approaches\n",
    "- Build a complete pipeline for generating safety evaluation datasets\n",
    "- Apply these techniques to create a power-seeking behavior evaluation dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating Large Language Models, one of the biggest challenges is obtaining high-quality evaluation datasets. While human-created datasets are valuable, they are expensive and time-consuming to produce. **Synthetic dataset generation** offers a scalable alternative by using LLMs themselves to create evaluation questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to build a systematic pipeline for generating synthetic evaluation datasets, with a specific focus on **LLM safety evaluation**. We'll use power-seeking behavior as our case study - a critical safety concern where models might exhibit desires for increased control or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Why synthetic generation?** It allows us to quickly create large, diverse datasets tailored to specific evaluation needs while maintaining quality through automated checks."

    "## 2. Understanding Power-Seeking Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we generate evaluation questions, let's clearly define what we're trying to measure. **Power-seeking behavior** in LLMs refers to actions or preferences that would increase the model's control over its environment or resources.\n",

    "### Key Categories of Power-Seeking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upward-mobility**: Seeking positions of greater control, influence, or autonomy\n",

    "This is a critical safety concern because models with power-seeking tendencies might:\n",
    "- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems\n",
    "- Manipulate users to achieve goals\n",
    "- Resist being shut down or modified\n",

    "## 11. Best Practices and Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with Clear Definitions**: Before generating questions, clearly define what behavior you're trying to measure. Vague definitions lead to poor quality questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Variance Prompts**: Different generation prompts create diversity and prevent repetitive patterns. This is crucial for comprehensive evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implement Quality Control**: Not all generated questions are good. Use LLM-as-judge with detailed rubrics to filter out low-quality items.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for Biases**: Analyze your dataset for systematic biases like:\n",
    "   - Answer position bias (A vs B)\n",
    "   - Length bias (longer answers being power-seeking)\n",
    "   - Category imbalance\n",
    "   - Scenario diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iterate on Your Process**: Use quality scores and analysis to improve your generation prompts and rubrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Over-obvious power-seeking**: If the behavior is too blatant, it doesn't test realistic scenarios\n",
    "- **Confounded measurements**: Ensure you're measuring power-seeking, not just helpfulness or intelligence\n",
    "- **Lack of subtlety**: Real safety risks often come from subtle behaviors, not cartoon villainy\n",
    "- **Insufficient diversity**: Questions that are too similar won't comprehensively test the behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions and Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-model generation**: Use different models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) to increase diversity\n",
    "2. **Human validation**: Sample and manually review questions for final quality check\n",
    "3. **Adversarial generation**: Create questions designed to be especially challenging\n",
    "4. **Dynamic difficulty**: Adjust question difficulty based on model performance\n",
    "5. **Cross-validation**: Test if different judges agree on quality scores"

    "## 12. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've built a complete pipeline for generating synthetic evaluation datasets for LLM safety assessment. We focused on power-seeking behavior as a case study, but these techniques can be applied to any behavioral evaluation need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we accomplished:**\n",
    "- Created structured data models for evaluation questions\n",
    "- Implemented diverse question generation using LLMs\n",
    "- Built quality control systems with LLM-as-judge\n",
    "- Analyzed datasets for biases and quality issues\n",
    "- Developed a complete, reusable pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Scale up generation to create larger datasets (hundreds or thousands of questions)\n",
    "- Test the evaluation dataset on actual language models\n",
    "- Extend to other safety concerns (deception, manipulation, etc.)\n",
    "- Combine with other evaluation methods for comprehensive safety assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ **Remember**: Synthetic dataset generation is a powerful tool, but it should complement, not replace, other evaluation methods. Always validate your synthetic datasets and be aware of their limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise for Students:\n",
    "\n",
    "Try modifying this pipeline to generate evaluation questions for a different safety concern, such as:\n",
    "- Deceptive behavior\n",
    "- Manipulation attempts  \n",
    "- Privacy violations\n",
    "- Harmful content generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how you would need to adjust the definitions, prompts, and quality rubrics for your chosen behavior."
